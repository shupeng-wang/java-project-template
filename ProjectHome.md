# Java Application Project Template #
> NOTE: The [Java Library Project Template](http://code.google.com/p/java-library-project-template/) can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/java-library-project-template/).
Creating a new Java project from scratch can involve a lot of tedium and overhead. The purpose of this project is to provide a template which can be easily modified to create your own Java project with minimal effort. Key features of this template include:

  * Maven2-based project, which can be loaded in NetBeans 6`.`5+`.`
  * Makefile wrapper for building the project (for those who like to simply type "make").
  * Standard, GNU-like project structure:
    * README
    * AUTHORS
    * INSTALL
    * ChangeLog
    * LICENSE
    * Makefile
    * src/
    * test/
    * ...
  * Standard, GNU-like project behavior:
    * --version
    * --help
  * Easy listing/editing of application parameters:
    * --prefget
    * --prefset
    * --prefdel
    * --preflist
  * Easy editing of application log levels:
    * --loglevel level
    * --loglevel logger=level
  * Builds JAR with dependencies compiled in.

This project template is "Public Domain" (Google will list it as licensed under the "New BSD License", simply because Google code does not have a "Public Domain" option). You may do whatever you want with the project template, and if you modify it, you can apply whatever license you want to the modified version (as long as you don't try to take this, original, project template out of the public domain). It would be nice if you would spread the word about this project template and point people to the original source of the project template (maybe give me some credit), but that isn't required. Hopefully this template will save you some time.

## Application vs. Library ##
The [Java Project Template](http://code.google.com/p/java-project-template/) is intended to create a Java application. To create a Java library, use the [Java Library Project Template](http://code.google.com/p/java-library-project-template/).

## Programming Language ##

The [Java Project Template](http://code.google.com/p/java-project-template/) and [Java Library Project Template](http://code.google.com/p/java-library-project-template/) have a corresponding [C++ Project Template](http://code.google.com/p/cpp-project-template/) and [C++ Library Project Template](http://code.google.com/p/cpp-library-project-template/).

## Development Environment Setup ##
Instructions for setting up a Java development environment for using the Java Project Template are given [at this link](http://code.google.com/p/java-project-template/wiki/DevelopmentEnvironmentSetup).

## Usage Instructions ##
Complete directions for using and applying this template are given [at this link](http://code.google.com/p/java-project-template/wiki/Basics).
